# ICP_GUI_Py-CLI_HSLAE
_Created for the course "Integrated development environments for creating GUI applications" V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University_

The program solves a heterogeneous system of linear algebraic equations of order 4 by the Kramer method in Python 3.10.6 using numpy.
The Kramer method (using Kramer's formulas) is easy to program, but does not provide sufficient accuracy, which can lead to errors.

Project source files `s2.py`.
Compiled file to run on Windows `s2.exe` with Pyinstaller.
